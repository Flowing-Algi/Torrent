For all dependencies, older version will probably work but not tested

makefile assumes gcc is at C:/MinGW/bin
makefile assumes Boost and OpenSSL are under winextern with relative paths


Boost 1.63.0 or later:
https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost/1.63.0/boost_1_63_0.7z?r=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boost.org%2Fusers%2Fhistory%2Fversion_1_63_0.html&ts=1497640951&use_mirror=superb-sea2

Setup boost dir in main makefile

OpenSSL 1.0.21 or later:
https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2l.tar.gz

Needs MinGW Msys package and perl to compile OpenSSL

under msys shell:
perl Configure mingw --prefix=/c/openssl
make depend #might need to change to -march=native
make
make install
