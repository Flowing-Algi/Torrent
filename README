You need: BOOST and libssl to compile

Don't valgrind the 7z library, it's really slow

Creating etags:

find . -name "*.c*" -or -name "*.h" | xargs etags




WINDOWS:
Tested with MinGW
You need:   MinGW with GCC, G++, and MSYS, 
            Boost 1.63.0 or later
            OpenSSL 1.0.21 or later
            Perl
makefile assumes gcc is at C:/MinGW/bin
makefile assumes Boost and OpenSSL are under winextern with relative paths
