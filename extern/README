Transmission is under folder: bit
./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-nls --without-gtk --enable-cli --enable-daemon

When in doubt, download fresh source (ideal) or svn co (not recommanded)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7z source file structure changed completely.
Currently would only compile under linux

! DO NOT CHANGE STRUCTURE !

If not compiling, check if you are using the right Defs.h
The Windows one is called DefsW.h
